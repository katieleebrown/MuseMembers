# MuseMembers
A full-stack web app designed to manage museum and cultural institution memberships. This app gives members access to their membership in real time; users have the ability to update member information, re-up their membership, and check in on site. 

# Why It's Made: 
This app is heavily inspired by my time spent working with museum and cultural institutions. After listening to member feedback, it was very evident that providing members more ways to access and edit their data would not only increase member engagement with the institution, but also save staff from needing to update indivdual memberships on a daily basis. As my instituions contracted with a third party to for their customer management system (or CMS), this feedback was something we really couldn't do anything about. I've created this app to fix this issue, and added in the additional feature of on-site check in, building in an additional member benefit of skipping the line and walking right in. The hope is that this app increases membership retention by giving users more access to their information, and boosts memberships as a whole to access the instant check in option. 

# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB

At it's core, this web app is a membership database. It houses all member information, and then allows users to access, update, and edit only their data through their log in. While HTML, CSS, and JS make up the base of this app, the project relies heavily on Node, Express, and MongoDB to make the magic happen. 

# Optimizations
The location-based check in feature of this app is the first time I've implemented a feature of this nature. While a definite push of my skill set, this was an essential part of the app to generate more memberships for a given institution. As location was essential to this feature, this was also my first app where the mobile version (and the app's responsiveness) was crucial to development. Coding mobile-first was a new approach to my CSS, but overall created an app that was better for the user.

# Lessons Learned
This project is still under construction. While I've learned quite a few lessons along the way, I'll update this section when more of the project is completed.
